# Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.
Built with **Vue.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, it showcases my projects, skills and blog posts in a responsive single-page application.
Internationalization is handled using **Vue I18n** and deployment is configured for GitHub Pages.
